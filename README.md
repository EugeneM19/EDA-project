World Happiness Report - EDA project
The **World Happiness Report 2024** highlights global well-being through exploratory data analysis (EDA) of its dataset. Key findings include:

### Data Cleaning
The analysis involved removing missing values and renaming columns for clarity, followed by visualizations to explore data distributions and variable relationships.

### Summary of Findings
1. **Key Determinants of Happiness**: Major factors influencing happiness include GDP per capita, social support, freedom to make life choices, and health life expectancy.

2. **Regional Happiness Trends**:
   - **High Happiness**: Predominantly in Scandinavian and Western European countries, with North America, Australia, and New Zealand also scoring high.
   - **Moderate Happiness**: Found in South America, Russia, and parts of East Asia.
   - **Lower Happiness**: Reported in regions like Africa, the Middle East, and India.

### Insights
- **Economic and Social Well-being**: Economic stability and strong social systems are vital for happiness. Investments in these areas can enhance overall well-being.
- **Freedom and Personal Choice**: Autonomy in life choices significantly contributes to happiness. Societies that support individual rights tend to have higher life satisfaction.
- **Regional Disparities**: Differences in happiness levels reflect economic development, social policies, and cultural contexts. Higher happiness correlates with robust social services and higher income, while lower happiness is linked to economic struggles and instability.

### Implications for Global Happiness
- **Policy Focus**: Improving economic conditions, expanding social support, ensuring quality healthcare, and promoting personal freedoms are essential for enhancing happiness.
- **Global Cooperation**: Tackling happiness disparities requires international efforts to improve living conditions in less happy regions.

In summary, enhancing global happiness involves a comprehensive approach addressing economic, social, and personal factors while considering regional differences.
